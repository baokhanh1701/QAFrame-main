# QandA Landing Page
While listening to webinars, there must be some questions that you cannot answer by yourself. We offer you the solution. Live Q&A gives you unlimited opportunities of making questions, satisfying your creativity and curiosity.
With Landing page, Login page and Q&A session, we offer you a great tool of questioning. Here at Live Q&A, users are able to post their question anonymously.

###Used:
- HTML/CSS/JS (ES6)
- Bootstrap 5
- Sweet Alert: https://sweetalert.js.org/
- AOS (Animate on Scroll): https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/
- And a lot of blood and tears to make CSS animations.

###Future development
- ReactJS (To properly build the functional page, since currently it is like template for later development)
- Considering databases to save questions and answers
- And, design Speaker/Technician account + Google Authentication

###P/S
To be honest, it is not that much of a functional project, but we have tried our best. I hope it will work someday in an event, or maybe a fair. And that would be awesome.
